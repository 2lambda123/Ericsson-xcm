Introduction
============

This is Extensible Connection-oriented Messaging (XCM) - an
Inter-process Messaging service. See 'include/xcm.h' for a detailed
description.

Build and Component Test Requirements
=====================================

To build this software the system needs to have the following packages
(not including "standard" things like a C compiler):

automake
autoconf (2.63 and later are known to work, some older versions will not)
libtool
python (2.x)
openssl (1.0.x, including the dev package with header files) (if UTLS/TLS
        is enabled)
lttng-ust (including the dev and tools package) (if LTTng is enabled)
libevent2 (if the 'xcm' command-line tool is enabled)
doxygen and plantuml (for documentation)
libsctp-dev (in case the SCTP transport is enabled)


To build and run tests:

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make check
# optional - run tests as root
sudo make check

Build and test process doesn't require root permission, but some test
cases will be skipped for non-root users.

If you don't have OpenSSL installed, and don't need the TLS and UTLS
transports, those can be disabled with:
./configure --disabled-tls

If you for some reason don't want LTTng tracing support, you may
disable LTTng UST with:
./configure --disable-lttng

If you don't need the 'xcm' command-line tool, you can avoid the
libevent dependency by using:
./configure --disable-xcm-tool

The control interface can be disabled by using:
./configure --disable-ctl

Static Library Builds
=====================

XCM depends on constructor functions to register transports into the
core library. If XCM is built statically, libxcm.a needs to be linked
to the application with the --whole-archive linker flag, or else all
transports will be removed.

Documentation
=============

XCM uses Doxygen (primarily in xcm.h) for its user manual and the API
descriptions.

Run
make doxygen
to generate the documentation.

The HTML version of the documentation will be available in doc/html/.
A PDF file with the same contents is in doc/latex/refman.pdf.

For doxygen PDF generation to work, you need to have the latex package
installed.
