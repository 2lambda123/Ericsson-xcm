XCM TODO
********

This file will, in whole or part, be obsoleted by the Hansoft backlog,
but we keep it for a bit longer.

Development Work
----------------
o Add libev/libevent/glib-based example programs
o Extend the test suite, in particular
  o Mock/stub OpenSSL and libc calls to allow more negative testing
o Increase the maximum allowed size for the UX transport
o Improve autoconf/automake
  o Make sure it builds on different version of Linux
  o Make sure it detects missing library runtime/dev packages
o Add likely/unlikely macros, and test if they improve performance
o Introduce integration test suite for vRCS (outside crl-xcm likely).
o Make all the RET_ convience macros into GOTO_ variants, and add LTTng
  logging to all those error cases.

Potential API Changes
---------------------
o Consider adding API to allow application to ask a connection socket what
  is its maximum message size supported.
o Consider if the exception fdset (from select(2) needs to be handled as
  well as read/write events (and thus go into the fd_event enum).
o Consider adding a connect() with automatic retry and a timeout
o Consider the possibility to have timeouts for connect(), send() and receive()
o xcm_receive() should return ssize_t.
